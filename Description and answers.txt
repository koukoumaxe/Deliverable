Part 1. (Coding)
	A . Provide a REST endpoint that will fetch all profiles (with all details) using the following filters:
		address = 127.0.0.1/age_sex_query
		#First argument: key= age value = INTEGER
		#Second argument: key= sex value = STRING 

	B . Provide a REST endpoint that given a set of names and a date, it will return
		1. A list of locations (coordinates), indicating the places those people were at that given date
			address = 127.0.0.1/name_date_query
			#First argument: key= name value = name1, name2, ..., nameN
			#Second argument: key= date value = dd.mm.yyyy  
		2. The locations are both coordinates and names of the locations (BONUS)
			address = 127.0.0.1/name_date_query
			#First argument: key= name value = name1, name2, ..., nameN
			#Second argument: key= date value = dd.mm.yyyy  
		3. A bounding box of those locations (BONUS) - ALMOST FINISHED
			#Using the coordinates, find the vector and then reverse it to get the perpenticular. 
			 Then by adding each point to the perpenticular you can get two extra points 
			 Using the initial two points and the two new calculated, you can form a binding box
			 
	C . Provide a REST endpoint which given a proximity parameter M in meters, and a date range
	 it will return the people who were closer than M meters among those dates - ALMOST FINISHED
		#First argument: key= m value = INTEGER
		#Second argument: key= dateRange value = {from: 'dd.mm.yyyy', to: 'dd.mm.yyyy'}  
		The solution currently returns the location of each individual during that date range.
		The distance between the individuals during a specific time can be calculated using : distance = math.sqrt( ((p1[0]-p2[0])**2)+((p1[1]-p2[1])**2) )
